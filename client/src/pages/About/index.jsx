              Born in Sioux Falls, SD, I was born with the innate desire and
              passion to help animals. Growing up, I was constantly trying to
              rescue every animal I could find. My childhood family consists of
              my mother, father, and brother.

              Naturally, upon graduating high school I went to college for
              Zoology and Veterinary Technology. A defining point in my life was
              when Ib egan work as a Veterinary Technician with my childhood
              hero,Veterinarian Dayton Williams. Unforuntately, alcoholism and
              trauma hithard and fast shortly after.

              Upon identifying that I am an alcoholic, I entered a 30 day
              rehabilitation center. With alcohol no longer holding me back I
              decided to accomplish my life-long dream of living near a beach
              and moved to Port St Lucie, Florida.

              Love soon struck I like a lightning bolt. In Florida I grew close
              to my future husband. Early in life I was diagnosed with medical
              issues that would make conceiving, carrying, and delivering a
              child near impossible. Despite all this, my husband and I found
              out we were expecting a little girl. On February 12, 2021,
              Yennefer entered our lives.

              Because of the difficult pregnancy and delivery, I became
              physically disabled. Identifying that I could no longer physically
              be a veterinary technician, I went back to school for Computer
              Science. Now, I enjoys working remotely from Knoxville, Tennessee
              in pajamas and watching Bluey for the 200th time while being a
              full time mom.
